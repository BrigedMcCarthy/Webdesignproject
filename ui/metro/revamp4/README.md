Revamp4 — Advanced Windows-like Start UI

This folder contains a more advanced, experimental re-creation of a Windows Start-like UI.

Files
- index.html — main demo page with groups, live tiles, app drawer, context menu, and settings pane.
- metro_revamp.css — styles for the revamp4 UI (responsive, animations, live tiles).
- metro_revamp.js — advanced JS: live tile simulation, app drawer population, drag/drop, keyboard navigation, context menu, settings wiring.

Revamp4 — File-tree viewer (retro 2000s redesign)

This folder now contains a retro-styled file-tree viewer that displays the project's file structure and updates automatically when the generator script runs.

Files
- index.html — the retro file-tree viewer (fetches /filetree.json periodically).
- metro_revamp.css — styles for the retro viewer.
- metro_revamp.js — client-side JS that fetches /filetree.json and renders the tree.


Generator (no third-party required)

I added a pure-Python generator that requires no third-party packages. It scans the repository and writes `filetree.json` to the project root.

Usage (Python only):

1. Generate once:

	python3 scripts/generate_filetree.py

2. Watch (polling):

	python3 scripts/generate_filetree.py --watch

The watch mode polls the filesystem every ~2.5s and rewrites `filetree.json` when it runs. This avoids third-party packages and works on any device with Python 3.

Alternative Node option (optional)

If you prefer Node-based tooling, the repo also contains `scripts/generate_filetree.js` and `package.json` with `npm run gen-tree` / `npm run watch-tree`. These are optional.

Serve and open viewer

	python3 -m http.server 8000
	http://localhost:8000/ui/metro/revamp4/index.html

Notes
- `filetree.json` is written to the repository root. The viewer polls `/filetree.json` every ~2.5s when auto-refresh is enabled.
- The original revamp4 demo has been moved to `ui/metro/revamp4/tests/` as a backup.

Dev server (optional, local only)

For a local experience that supports publishing guestbook entries and resetting the build, you can run the simple dev server included in `scripts/dev_server.py`.

Run:

	python3 scripts/dev_server.py 8000

This server will serve the repository root and provides these POST endpoints used by the viewer during local development:

- `POST /guestbook` — append a single entry (expects JSON `{name,msg}`)
- `POST /guestbook/upload` — overwrite `guestbook.json` with the provided JSON array (used for moderation/deletes)
- `POST /reset-build` — set `build=1` in `filetree.json`
- `POST /upload-filetree` — overwrite `filetree.json` with raw JSON body

Notes
- The dev server is intentionally minimal and unsecured — use it only in local development.
- If you don't run the dev server, the viewer will fall back to storing guestbook entries in your browser's `localStorage` and will show a 'local' badge next to those entries.

Commit / Tidy summary

This revamp4 branch includes the following user-facing improvements and quality tidy work:

- Retro file-tree viewer that polls `/filetree.json` and renders a collapsible tree.
- Pure-Python generator (`scripts/generate_filetree.py`) to create `filetree.json` without third-party installs.
- Optional local dev server (`scripts/dev_server.py`) providing guestbook and reset endpoints for development.
- UI improvements: search/filter, preview modal for text/images, copy-permalink, theme toggle (retro/modern), keyboard navigation, smooth collapse/expand animation, and guestbook moderation controls.
- Accessibility: ARIA roles/labels on toolbar and tree, keyboard focus handling in the preview modal, and focus outlines for keyboard users.

If you're happy with these changes, a suggested commit message is:

	feat(revamp4): add retro file-tree viewer, search, preview, theme toggle and dev server; improve guestbook sync and accessibility

You can create the commit locally with:

	git add ui/metro/revamp4 scripts/dev_server.py scripts/generate_filetree.py
	git commit -m "feat(revamp4): add retro file-tree viewer, search, preview, theme toggle and dev server; improve guestbook sync and accessibility"

Thanks — the viewer is now a nicer, more accessible local dev tool. If you want, I can prepare a PR or squash these changes into a single commit for you.
